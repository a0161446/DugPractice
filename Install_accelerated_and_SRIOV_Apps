These instructions will be used to install the accelerated app along with SRIOV app

cd /home/deployer

This step will look for the current version of accelerated-bridge-cin-daemonset

grep -R accelerated-bridge-cin-daemonset.yaml .

This command will create and install the accelerated bridge-cni-daemonset

kubectl create -f ./images/k8s-v1.16/accelerated-bridge-cni-daemonset.yaml


cd /home/deployer/accelerated-bridge-cni/

cat ./images/k8s-v1.16/accelerated-bridge-cni-daemonset.yaml


kubectl version 
	This command will give you listings of "GitVersion"

		git version
	
	
	To deploy accelerated-bridge-cni-daemonset.yaml, run the command below

	
	kubectl create -f ./images/k8s-v1.16/accelerated-bridge-cni-daemonset.yaml
	
	
	cd /home/deployer/accelerated-bridge-cni/
	kubectl create -f ./images/k8s-v1.16/accelerated-bridge-cni-daemonset.yaml
	
		
	Then run this command to see the modules 

	kubectl get ds -A
	
	Verify that "kube-accelerated-bridge-cni-ds-amd64" is being created.
	
	Next
	
	cd /home/deployer/sriov-network-device-plugin/
	
	kubectl apply -f configMap.yaml
	kubectl apply -f sriovdp-daemonset.yaml
	
	
	
	Check if there are deployments happening:
	
	cd /home/deployer/sriov-network-device-plugin/deployments
	
	cat configMap.yaml
	
	cd /home/deployer/sriov-network-device-plugin
	kubectl create -f deployments/configMap.yaml
	
	
	Next create daemonset:
	kubectl create -f deployments/k8s-v1.16/sriovdp-daemonset.yaml
	
	
	These entries should be displayed after your ran the previous command.

	Daemonset.apps/kube-sriov-device-plugin-amd64 created
	Daemonset.apps/kube-sriov-device-plugin-ppc64le created
	Daemonset.apps/kube-sriov-device-plugin-arm64 created
	
	Next, run this command a look to see if the 3 above services are being created.

	kubectl get ds -A
	
	
	To Validate SRIOV: run the command below

	kubectl -n kube-system get  pods |grep sriov

	You should be able to see the sriov entries.
	
	
	kubectl create -f deployments/configMap.yaml
